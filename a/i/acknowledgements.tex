This collection would not have been possible without the support (and enabling)
from many excellent humans in my life. I'm extremely fortunate to have witnesses
for my personal growth over the years covered by these writings.

In particular, I'd like to thank to Scott for his patience with my neuroses, Leo
for opening my eyes to what we can see, Donald for his keen interest in my
stories, Jamie for supervising my performance, and Ian for endless enthusiasm
for long nights at the bar.
