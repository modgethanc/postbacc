This collection would not have been possible without the support (and enabling)
from many excellent humans in my life. Thanks to Scott for his patience with my
neuroses, Leo for opening my eyes to what we can see, Donald for his interest in
my stories, Jamie for supervising my performance, and Ian for endless enthusiasm
for long nights at the bar.
