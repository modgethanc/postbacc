\textit{Fall 2014; Dr. Scott Sandage}

Also known as, there's no such thing as the American Dream; we'll all kill
ourselves trying.

A notable side pursuit: while reading Benjamin Franklin, I happened to travel
near his grave, so I took a selfie with i and sent it to the professor.
Later in the semester, I ended up passing past the graves of multiple
other authors, so I made a map of every grave of authors from that class, and
started collecting them on road trips.
